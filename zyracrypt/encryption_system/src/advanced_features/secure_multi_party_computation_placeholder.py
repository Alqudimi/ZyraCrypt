# Placeholder for Secure Multi-Party Computation (SMC)
# SMC allows multiple parties to jointly compute a function over their inputs
# while keeping those inputs private. This is a highly advanced and research-intensive
# field of cryptography, often relying on complex protocols like Garbled Circuits,
# Homomorphic Encryption, or Secret Sharing schemes.
# A full implementation is beyond the scope of a general Python library without
# dedicated cryptographic research and specialized frameworks (e.g., MP-SPDZ, FHE libraries).
