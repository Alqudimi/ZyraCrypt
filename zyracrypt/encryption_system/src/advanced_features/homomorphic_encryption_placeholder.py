# Placeholder for Homomorphic Encryption (HE)
# Homomorphic Encryption allows computations to be performed on encrypted data
# without decrypting it first. This is a very powerful but computationally intensive
# cryptographic primitive. There are different types (partially, somewhat, fully homomorphic).
# Full Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) is still an active area of research and practical
# implementations often require specialized libraries (e.g., Microsoft SEAL, HElib)
# and are typically written in C++ for performance.
