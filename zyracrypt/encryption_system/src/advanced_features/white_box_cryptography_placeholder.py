# Placeholder for White-Box Cryptography
# White-box cryptography aims to protect cryptographic keys even when the attacker
# has full control over the execution environment (e.g., software running on a user's device).
# This is typically achieved through complex obfuscation and encoding techniques.
# Implementing true white-box cryptography is highly specialized and often involves
# patented techniques and is beyond the scope of a general Python library without
# dedicated research and development.
