## Installation and Setup

### What are the system requirements?

**Minimum Requirements:**
- Python 3.11 or higher
- 512MB RAM
- 100MB storage space
- Internet connection for installation

**Recommended:**
- Python 3.11+ (latest stable)
- 2GB RAM for enterprise features
- Multi-core processor with AES-NI support
- 500MB storage space

### Why do I need Python 3.11+?

Python 3.11+ is required for:
- Modern type hints and performance features
- Enhanced security capabilities
- Compatibility with latest cryptographic libraries
- Optimal performance optimizations

### Can I install without Cython?

Yes, the library supports installation without Cython. If Cython is not available:
- The setup will automatically fall back to pure Python
- Performance may be reduced for some operations
- All functionality remains available
- You'll see a warning during installation

### How do I verify the installation is working?

```python
# Quick verification script
import sys
import os

# Setup paths
encryption_root = os.path.join(os.getcwd(), 'alqudimi_encryption_system')
encryption_src = os.path.join(encryption_root, 'encryption_system', 'src')
sys.path.insert(0, encryption_root)
sys.path.insert(0, encryption_src)

try:
    from core_cryptography.symmetric_encryption import SymmetricEncryption
    symmetric = SymmetricEncryption()
    print("✓ Installation successful!")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"✗ Installation issue: {e}")
```

## Usage and Implementation

### How do I get started with basic encryption?

Here's a minimal example:

```python
import os
import sys

# Setup library path
encryption_root = os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), 'alqudimi_encryption_system')
encryption_src = os.path.join(encryption_root, 'encryption_system', 'src')
sys.path.insert(0, encryption_root)
sys.path.insert(0, encryption_src)

from core_cryptography.encryption_framework import EncryptionFramework

# Initialize
framework = EncryptionFramework()
key = os.urandom(32)  # 256-bit key

# Encrypt
plaintext = b"Hello, World!"
algorithm, iv, ciphertext, tag = framework.encrypt(plaintext, key)

print(f"Encrypted with {algorithm}")
```

### Should I use symmetric or asymmetric encryption?

**Use Symmetric Encryption when:**
- Encrypting large amounts of data
- You can securely share the key
- You need high performance
- Both parties trust each other

**Use Asymmetric Encryption when:**
- You don't have a pre-shared key
- You need digital signatures
- You're establishing secure communication
- You need non-repudiation

**Best Practice:** Use asymmetric encryption to exchange symmetric keys, then use symmetric encryption for data.

### How do I choose the right algorithm?

**For Symmetric Encryption:**
- **AES-256-GCM**: Default choice, hardware accelerated, NIST approved
- **ChaCha20-Poly1305**: Better for systems without AES-NI, mobile devices

**For Asymmetric Encryption:**
- **RSA-2048**: Good for compatibility, encryption, and signatures
- **ECC P-256**: Faster, smaller keys, modern applications
- **Post-Quantum**: For future-proofing against quantum computers

### How do I handle errors properly?

```python
try:
    # Crypto operation
    ciphertext, tag = symmetric.encrypt_aes_gcm(key, iv, plaintext)
except ValueError as e:
    # Handle parameter errors (wrong key length, etc.)
    print(f"Parameter error: {e}")
except Exception as e:
    # Handle unexpected errors
    print(f"Encryption failed: {e}")
    # Log for debugging, but don't expose details to users
```

### Can I encrypt files larger than available memory?

Yes, use streaming encryption:

```python
from specialized_security.file_encryption_manager import FileEncryptionManager

file_crypto = FileEncryptionManager()
key = file_crypto.generate_file_key()

# Encrypt large file in chunks
with open('large_file.bin', 'rb') as infile:
    with open('large_file.enc', 'wb') as outfile:
        encrypted_package = file_crypto.encrypt_file_stream(infile, outfile, key)
```

## Security and Compliance

### Is the library quantum-resistant?

Yes, the library includes post-quantum cryptography:
- **ML-KEM (Kyber)**: Quantum-resistant key encapsulation
- **ML-DSA (Dilithium)**: Quantum-resistant digital signatures
- **Hybrid modes**: Combining classical and post-quantum algorithms

Current quantum computers cannot break these algorithms, providing protection against future quantum threats.

### How secure are the random number generators?

The library uses cryptographically secure random number generators:
- **os.urandom()**: Operating system's CSPRNG
- **Hardware entropy**: When available (Intel RDRAND, etc.)
- **Continuous testing**: Entropy quality monitoring

Never use `random.random()` or similar for cryptographic purposes.

### Does the library protect against side-channel attacks?

Yes, the library includes side-channel resistance:
- **Constant-time operations**: Prevents timing attacks
- **Secure memory handling**: Protects against memory-based attacks
- **Cache-resistant algorithms**: Mitigates cache timing attacks
- **Random delays**: Optional protection against advanced timing analysis

### Is the library FIPS compliant?

The library uses FIPS-approved algorithms:
- AES in FIPS-approved modes
- SHA-2 and SHA-3 hash functions
- ECDSA with NIST curves
- RSA with approved padding

FIPS 140-2 Level 3 certification is planned for future releases.

### How should I manage cryptographic keys?

**Best Practices:**
- Use the built-in key management system
- Never hardcode keys in source code
- Use environment variables or key management services
- Implement key rotation
- Use envelope encryption for large datasets
- Consider HSM integration for high-security environments

### Can I use this for financial or healthcare applications?

Yes, the library is designed for regulated industries:
- Uses industry-standard algorithms
- Includes audit logging capabilities
- Supports compliance requirements (HIPAA, PCI DSS, etc.)
- Provides non-repudiation through digital signatures

However, consult with compliance experts for your specific requirements.

## Performance and Optimization

### How fast is the library?

Performance depends on your system and data size:
- **Small data (1KB)**: Sub-millisecond encryption
- **Large data (1MB)**: 400+ MB/s throughput
- **Hardware acceleration**: 2-5x performance improvement with AES-NI

See [PERFORMANCE.md](PERFORMANCE.md) for detailed benchmarks.

### How can I improve performance?

**Optimization strategies:**
1. **Enable hardware acceleration** (AES-NI, AVX)
2. **Use appropriate algorithms** for your data size
3. **Implement connection pooling** for high-throughput scenarios
4. **Use streaming** for large datasets
5. **Profile your application** to identify bottlenecks

### Does the library support parallel processing?

Yes, the library supports parallelization:
- Thread-safe operations
- Worker pool implementations
- Parallel bulk encryption
- Multi-core utilization

See examples in [EXAMPLES.md](EXAMPLES.md) for implementation details.

### How much memory does the library use?

Memory usage varies by operation:
- **Basic encryption**: Minimal overhead (~100KB)
- **Key generation**: Moderate (RSA-4096: ~10MB temporary)
- **Streaming operations**: Constant memory usage
- **Bulk operations**: Linear with data size

Use streaming for large datasets to minimize memory usage.

## Troubleshooting

### I'm getting import errors. What should I do?

**Common solutions:**
1. Verify Python path is set correctly
2. Check that all dependencies are installed
3. Ensure Python version is 3.11+
4. Try installing in a fresh virtual environment

See [TROUBLESHOOTING.md](TROUBLESHOOTING.md) for detailed guidance.

### Encryption is slower than expected. How can I optimize?

**Diagnostic steps:**
1. Check if hardware acceleration is enabled
2. Verify you're using appropriate algorithms
3. Profile your code to identify bottlenecks
4. Consider using parallel processing for bulk operations

### I'm getting "Invalid tag" errors during decryption. What's wrong?

**Common causes:**
1. **Data corruption**: Verify ciphertext and tag integrity
2. **Wrong key**: Ensure you're using the correct decryption key
3. **Parameter mismatch**: Check IV matches the one used for encryption
4. **Encoding issues**: Verify proper base64 encoding/decoding

### The Flask API won't start. What's the issue?

**Check these requirements:**
1. Set `SESSION_SECRET` environment variable
