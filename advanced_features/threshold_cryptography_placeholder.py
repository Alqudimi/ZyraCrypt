# Placeholder for Threshold Cryptography
# This feature involves distributing cryptographic operations (e.g., decryption, signing)
# among multiple parties such that a threshold number of parties must cooperate
# to perform the operation. This typically requires advanced cryptographic schemes
# like Shamir's Secret Sharing or more complex threshold signature schemes.
# Implementation would require specialized libraries or custom cryptographic constructions.
